        This is an x-file. It contains extensions to the normal registry. A Singleton is typically registered with an interface
        bound to a single implementation. In the x-file cases, two (or more) implementations of the same Singleton is desired
        (e.g., a TextEnvelopeService that uses the file system while another TextEnvelopeService that uses a database via JPA).
